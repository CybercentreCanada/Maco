    This model defines common fields for output of a script targeting a specific malware family.
    Usage of this model will allow for easier sharing of scripts between different authors and systems.
    The model will not define fields for all data that can be extracted from a binary, only the most common.
    This is to make it easier for authors to understand and use the model.

    This model can have new fields added in the future if they become more common,
    but the intent is to avoid removing or modifying existing fields, for backwards compatibility.

    Where data does not fit with the current model, the 'others' field should be used.
    Contents in this field is not defined by the model and verification/normalisation is up to
    the author and whatever systems run the scripts.
    If many decoders define similar data in the 'others' field, that field should be migrated to this model.

    The model must be kept relatively flat, with nested lists of dictionaries to be avoided.
    This is to make queries simpler to write in sql, elasticsearch and other storage systems.

    Malware and systems that investigate malware can do pretty much anything.
    This model needs to be simple and flexible to make sharing easy.
    Some things should be out of scope for this model.
    Responsibility for these things are up to authors and systems that use this model.

    Out of scope
    * Verifying anything in the 'others' dict, including that it is json-compatible.
        * We don't know anything about the structure
        * checking is json compatible requires dumping to json string, which can be slow
    * Connecting specific config items to malware behaviour catalog
        * i.e. "Persistence::Modify Registry" with 'registry' item from model (SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\)
        * due to complexity and normalisation difficulties
        * much malware behaviour is not related to specific config items
    * Normalisation/verification of individual properties
        * i.e. lowercase filepaths - some filesystems are case sensitive
        * i.e. checking registry hives match known - not enough SME and too complex for a simple model
        * generally, this quickly becomes complex (validating a fully defined http item)
        * calling systems are probably performing their own validation anyway
    * requiring specific properties to be set
        * i.e. if http item is defined, requiring hostname to be set
        * Some use cases always seem to exist where a property should not be set
